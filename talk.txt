Circle of life (working title)

You play the role of a child
who's abused

You make the choices in his life
And decide what his story is

Over time, you grow up.
You get married.
And have children.

You make the choices in both the lives 
of the adult
and the child

As an adult, will you 
make the same mistakes your parent did?
Will you be forced to commit the same mistakes again?

Your child will grow up and have children.
You will write their story.
What will be your legacy?
